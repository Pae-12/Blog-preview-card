### Built with

- Flexboxes
- Media query

### What I learned

This challenge helped me learn the use of media queries and flexboxes. These topics were fuzzy to me before, but now, I know where I stand.

This also helped me notice how much time I currently take to complete such a simple project, making me want to increase my pace.

Moreover, this has helped me gain confidence in my current skills, providing me with the motivation to keep learning and practicing.

### Continued development

I'll keep practicing flexboxes, grids, and media queries, since I'm still rough at using them.

I'll keep participating in similar challenges to reinforce the things I've learned.
